# Module Migration Plan

This plan turns the design boundary into implementation without a big-bang move.

## Phase 0: Design Baseline

Status: complete.

Deliverables:

- `modules/README.md`
- `modules/DESIGN.md`
- `modules/CURRENT_MAP.md`
- `modules/DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`
- module README files

Validation:

- documentation is present
- `git diff --check`
- current focused tests still pass

## Phase 1: Contract Packages

Status: complete.

Goal: create stable contracts before moving implementation.

Actions:

- Add core contract packages for shared IDs/events where needed.

Validation:

- package-local tests
- `go test ./modules/...`
- `go test ./internal/adapter/modulebridge`

Actions:

- Wrap `internal/domain/llm` provider contracts with `modules/llm`.
- Wrap `internal/infrastructure/tts` provider contracts with `modules/tts`.

- `go test ./modules -run TestModuleHTTPHandlersDoNotOwnResponseContracts -count=1`

## Phase 3: Chat / Worker Split

Status: in progress.

Goal: separate user-facing orchestration from execution side effects.

Actions:

- Keep `internal/application/service/worker_execution_*` under worker ownership.
- Extract Chat-facing orchestration policies from mixed orchestrator files.
- Keep Coder/Worker execution routes from importing TTS/STT.

Current deliverable:

- `internal/adapter/modulebridge` exposes the existing orchestrator processor as `modules/chat.Service`.
- `internal/adapter/modulebridge` exposes a runtime Chat service constructor that wires the Mio route policy.
- `modules/chat.RoutePolicy` is the module contract for route decision.

- `modules/chat` owns route-name normalization from runtime route labels into module routes.
- `modules/chat` owns Viewer input default normalization for channel and user identity.
- `modules/chat` owns IdleChat forecast provider policy and speaker LLM option normalization; `cmd/picoclaw` still creates concrete providers and logs selection.
- `modules/chat` owns IdleChat topic category contracts, daily seed DTOs, topic seed/candidate/judge DTOs, deterministic topic validation, RSS seed item parsing, seed selection/labels, prompt text construction, JSON parsing, judge thresholds, and recent-topic similarity checks; `internal/application/idlechat` now keeps only the remaining orchestration and source-fetching glue around the module contract.

- `modules/worker` owns Coder capability plan construction from detected LLM capabilities, configured coder slots, and quality overrides; `cmd/picoclaw` converts app/domain DTOs.
- `modules/worker` owns autonomous execution route classification, capability selection, execution step labels, failure classification, retry prompt construction, and route/contract attempt verification policy; `internal/application/orchestrator` keeps conversion from internal contract/result types and executor invocation.
- `/viewer/modules/health` includes Chat service and Worker executor status.
- `/viewer/modules/chat/route` exposes Chat route decisions through the module contract.
- `/viewer/modules/worker/diagnostics` exposes Worker executor health and supported tools without executing actions.
- `modules/llm` owns local LLM role/alias resolution for provider kind, base URL, model, timeout, and concurrency; `cmd/picoclaw` keeps concrete provider construction and middleware wiring.

- `modules/llm` owns Coder provider validation/planning; `internal/infrastructure/llm/factory` converts validated plans into concrete provider instances.
- `modules/llm` owns OpenAI-compatible ThinkingBridge request/response cleanup policy; `internal/infrastructure/llm/providers/openai` applies those rules around concrete HTTP calls.

Remaining work:

- Move route-decision policy implementation out of legacy agent/orchestrator internals once the module contract can represent the legacy policy inputs directly.
- Move remaining IdleChat topic generation orchestration, prompt file loading, network source fetching, and cache lifecycle behind Chat/LLM module seams after the pure topic policy is stable.
- Split remaining Viewer/TTS pending and playback state implementation details from provider-owned TTS concerns.

Validation:

- orchestrator tests
- worker execution tests
- route dispatch tests

Current validation:

- `go test ./internal/application/service ./internal/application/orchestrator ./cmd/picoclaw ./internal/adapter/modulebridge ./modules/...`
- `go test ./...`

## Phase 4: TTS/STT Viewer Boundary Cleanup

Status: in progress.

- `modules/tts` owns route-based TTS session metadata planning for message and distributed orchestrator lifecycles; `internal/application/orchestrator` converts route decisions into module inputs and applies the plan to the existing bridge contract.
- `modules/tts` owns TTS text chunking rules and streaming chunk pending/emitted state; `internal/application/orchestrator` asks the module chunker for chunks before applying them to TTS and VTuber bridges.
- `modules/tts` owns speech text filtering, emotion planning, emotion state/context types, and emotion prefix policy; the legacy app-layer wrapper has been retired.
- `modules/tts` owns TTS runtime provider priority, playback command normalization, voice selection, and Irodori provider option planning; `cmd/picoclaw` converts app config into module DTOs and applies the returned plan to concrete provider construction.

- `modules/stt` owns Viewer-input snapshot construction, including endpoint/path defaults, URL normalization, and configured flags.
- `modules/stt` owns runtime STT provider option planning and defaults; `cmd/picoclaw` converts app config into module DTOs and applies the returned plan to concrete provider construction.

- `/viewer/modules/health` includes `stt.viewer_input` separately from `stt`.
- Module route registration now has a single `registerModuleRoutes` entry point, and the manifest endpoints are checked against the registered module routes.
- Module route tests verify every registered `/viewer/modules/*` endpoint serves JSON with runtime contract dependencies and rejects wrong HTTP methods.

Validation:

- `internal/adapter/viewer/viewer_audio_button.test.mjs`
- `cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts_*` tests
- STT admin/capture tests

Current validation:

- `go test ./cmd/picoclaw ./internal/application/service ./internal/application/orchestrator ./internal/adapter/modulebridge ./internal/infrastructure/tts ./internal/infrastructure/stt ./internal/infrastructure/routing ./modules/...`
- `go test ./...`
- `cmd/picoclaw` module manifest tests verify manifest endpoint coverage and route registration coverage.
- `cmd/picoclaw` module route tests verify every registered module endpoint returns JSON when provided module-contract dependencies.

## Phase 5: Final Package Move Or Alias Stabilization

Goal: decide whether physical package moves are worth the churn.

Options:

1. Keep current package paths and enforce ownership by documentation/tests.
2. Move code into module-named packages with minimal adapter code where runtime wiring still needs it.

Decision gate:

- Choose option 2 only if import boundary tests and the remaining adapters keep behavior stable.

## Non-goals

- Do not move implementation during the design-completion phase.
- Do not create external repos for modules.
- Do not store module source under `.git/worktrees/*`.
- Do not change runtime behavior only to make package names look cleaner.
