# Current Code Ownership Map

This file maps the current repository layout to the target module design. It is an ownership map, not a command to move files immediately.

## Summary

Current module implementation status:

- `cmd/picoclaw` registers module endpoints through `registerModuleRoutes`, and tests verify manifest endpoints match registered module routes.
- `cmd/picoclaw` module route tests verify every registered `/viewer/modules/*` endpoint returns JSON with module-contract dependencies and rejects wrong HTTP methods.
- `modules/dependency_rules_test.go` enforces module import direction and key implementation boundary rules.
- `modules/dependency_rules_test.go` prevents `internal/adapter/modulebridge` from owning module health report literals; health report policy belongs under `modules/*`.
- `modules/dependency_rules_test.go` prevents `internal/adapter/modulebridge` from owning Worker result literals or TTS emotion provider reason keys; those adapter policies belong under `modules/*`.

- `modules/dependency_rules_test.go` prevents `cmd/picoclaw` from owning Coder setup planning and LightMemory default policy; that policy belongs under `modules/worker`.
- `modules/dependency_rules_test.go` also prevents `cmd/picoclaw/module_*.go` from owning `module*Request`/`module*Response` contracts or direct JSON response wiring; request/response/report/snapshot contracts and generic module HTTP response helpers belong under `modules/*`.
- Existing runtime wiring still has provider/composition code under `internal/...`, but TTS speech filtering, emotion planning, prefix policy, playback/session state, route planning, chunking, and runtime provider option planning are now owned by `modules/tts`.
- Provider extraction is therefore started, not complete.

### Core

Current primary owners:

- shared domain value objects
- event contracts in `internal/application/orchestrator/event.go`
- config and lifecycle policies that are not module-specific
- state ownership rules documented in `rules/common/rules_state_management.md`

Split rule:

- Core may define contracts but not concrete providers
- Core must not import module-specific implementations

### LLM

Current primary owners:

- `internal/domain/llm`
- `internal/infrastructure/llm`
- `cmd/picoclaw/llm_runtime_factory.go`
- `cmd/picoclaw/llm_runtime_warmup.go`

- `modules/llm` owns OpenAI-compatible ThinkingBridge request/response cleanup policy; `internal/infrastructure/llm/providers/openai` applies those rules around concrete HTTP calls.

### TTS

Current primary owners:

- `modules/tts`
- `internal/infrastructure/tts`
- `cmd/picoclaw/tts_runtime_*`
- `cmd/picoclaw/tts_client_bridge.go`
- `cmd/picoclaw/tts_browser_audio.go`

Cross-boundary owners:

- `cmd/picoclaw/tts_playback_ack.go`
- `cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts_pending.go`
- `cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts_queue.go`
- `cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts_timeout.go`

These cross-boundary files should ultimately be split so provider-specific TTS stays in tts and session/pending state stays in chat/core.
Runtime diagnostics expose the TTS provider contract separately from `tts.playback` state.

### STT

Current primary owners:

- `internal/infrastructure/stt`
- `cmd/picoclaw/stt_runtime_*`
- `internal/adapter/viewer/stt_*`

Split rule:

- `modules/stt` owns HTTP transcription result normalization, error-status mapping, and ChatInput envelope construction; `internal/infrastructure/stt` keeps multipart file reads, provider invocation, and HTTP response writing.
- `modules/stt.ViewerInputObserver`, `BuildViewerInputHealthReport`, and Viewer input endpoint messages are the current contracts for observing Viewer STT input and transcript injection endpoints without making them provider state.
- Viewer STT debug artifact default paths and archive filename construction live in `modules/stt`; the Viewer adapter owns request handling and writes.
- Runtime diagnostics expose the STT provider contract separately from `stt.viewer_input` state.

## Known Mixed Areas

These areas are intentionally not moved yet because they mix runtime wiring, state ownership, and provider contracts:

- `cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts_*`
- `cmd/picoclaw/tts_playback_ack.go`
- `internal/application/orchestrator/*tts*`
- `internal/adapter/viewer/viewer_audio_button.test.mjs`
- `internal/adapter/viewer/stt_capture_handler.go`

Before moving them, add focused tests proving display, playback ACK, pending drain, and transcript injection behavior.

## Boundary Tests

Current automated boundary checks live in `modules/dependency_rules_test.go`.

They verify:

- `modules/*` contract packages only import allowed module dependencies.
- `modules/*` contract packages do not import `internal/*` or `cmd/*`.
- `internal/adapter/modulebridge` does not import the `cmd/picoclaw` composition root.
- TTS and STT infrastructure do not import each other or unrelated runtime modules.
- Worker service code does not import TTS/STT provider implementations, Viewer implementation, or TTS/STT modules.
- `cmd/picoclaw/module_*.go` does not define `module*Response` contracts; module-facing HTTP response contracts stay under `modules/*`.
