## Current Main Files

internal/application/idlechat, cmd/picoclaw/runtime_idlechat*.go, cmd/picoclaw/idlechat_tts*.go

## Migration Boundary

This feature package is a registrar/facade entry point only. IdleChat Viewer route registration and background start handoff are owned by `internal/features/idlechat/registrar.go`; existing handler and orchestrator implementations stay in the listed current files until contract tests and caller handoff are added for the relevant phase.
