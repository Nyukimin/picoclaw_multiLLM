# Feature Registrars

This directory is the Ver0.80 feature registrar inventory. It does not move existing implementations by itself.

Each feature keeps only README, ports, and registrar scaffolding until a later phase moves route registration or runtime wiring behind the feature facade.

## Ver0.80 Registrar Status

HTTP route registration has been handed off from `cmd/picoclaw/routes.go` to feature registrars for Viewer base, IdleChat, Ops, Voice/STT/TTS, Web/browser, Knowledge/Memory/Source, Reports/Governance/Sandbox/SuperAgent/AIWorkflow, and Channels.

Handler bodies, providers, stores, runtime background jobs, and CLI implementations remain in their existing legacy-body files unless a later phase explicitly moves them. `security` and `distributed` currently record ownership boundaries but do not own direct HTTP route registration in this pass.

## Inventory

- `channels`: Inbound envelope, channel policy, response adapter, and external channel boundary.
- `chat`: User dialogue, route decisions, final response, and Viewer send contract.
- `core`: Process-level manifest, health, topology handoff, and shared lifecycle boundaries.
- `distributed`: Transport, remote agent availability, and delivery boundary.
- `governance`: Skill governance, trigger logs, change gates, and external PR audit boundary.
- `heartbeat`: Heartbeat due run, workstream trigger, and draft report launch boundary.
- `idlechat`: IdleChat session lifecycle, topic generation, speakers, stop, and TTS trigger boundary.
- `knowledge`: Knowledge import, wiki index, vocabulary, glossary, and review-ready knowledge artifacts.
- `llm`: Role provider selection, health, diagnostics, and runtime provider planning.
- `memory`: Observed, candidate, validated, promoted, recall, and prompt injection state boundary.
