# Voice Feature

## Owner

Voice

## Inputs

voice websocket request, VDS gateway config, audio route event, active audio control, voice input mode

## Outputs

voice session event, LLM delta/final, runtime URL plan, bridge availability

## Side Effects

websocket streaming, bridge calls, audio event emission through existing runtime code

## Persistence

existing voice session/runtime state only

## Logs

session_id, utterance_id, route, input mode, status, error kind

## Error Contract

voice disabled, session mismatch, LLM busy, and provider failure are explicit

## Current Main Files

modules/voicechat, modules/stt, modules/tts, cmd/picoclaw/voice_chat_runtime_*.go, cmd/picoclaw/stt_runtime_*.go, cmd/picoclaw/tts_*.go, internal/adapter/viewer/audio_router_sse.go

## Current Route Boundary

- `/voice-chat`
- `/voice-chat-ws`
- `/audio-router/events`
- `/viewer/active-control`
- STT routes delegated to `internal/features/stt`
- TTS routes delegated to `internal/features/tts`

## Migration Boundary

This feature package is a registrar/facade entry point only. Existing implementation stays in the listed current files until contract tests and caller handoff are added for the relevant phase. Voice currently acts as the Voice / STT / TTS composite registrar for the Ver0.80 audio feature group.
